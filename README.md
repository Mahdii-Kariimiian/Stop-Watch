## Overview
I designed an alarm clock in this project. The current time can be found on the page and the user can choose the desired hour and minute for the alarm by using two inputs. After selecting and setting the alarm, the alarm will sound at the set time. This was a good practice for creating a large number of HTML elements using JavaScript.
